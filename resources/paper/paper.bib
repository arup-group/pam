  abstract = {We introduce ActivitySim, a simulator that generates daily activities for a population of millions of individual agents, each characterized by a set of demographic attributes that is based on US census data. The daily schedules for each agent that consist of a sequence of typical activities, such as sleeping, shopping, working etc., with their respecting starting and ending times. Further, each of the scheduled activities is geo-located at an appropriate location for the type of activity and for the personal situation of the agent, like a business or private residence. ActivitySim has been developed as part of a larger effort to understand the interdependencies among national infrastructure networks and their demand profiles that emerge from the different activities of individuals in both baseline as well as emergency scenarios, such as hurricane evacuations. We present the scalable software engineering principles underlying ActivitySim, the socio-technical modeling paradigms that drive the activity generation, and proof-of-principle results for a 2.6 M agent scenario in the Twin Cities, MN, area.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the eqasim framework with the aim to provide a consistent pipeline from raw data to a final transport simulation. It therefore lays the foundation to achieve fully reproducible agent-based transport simulations. While the pathway from raw data to a generic synthetic travel demand was covered previously for specific use cases, here the general methodology is summarized. Furthermore, the tools and methods for combining MATSim simulations with flexibly definable discrete choice models is described, which is the core of the existing simulation implementations of eqasim for \^ile-de-France, Switzerland, Sao Paulo and California.},
