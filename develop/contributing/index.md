# Contributing

PAM is an actively maintained and utilised project. 
Our goals are to enhance:

- Theoretical Quality: Expert driven features with research and open case studies.
- Feature Quality: Broadly useful and extendable features with good documentation and testing.

Less abstractly, there are a good number of [coding][coding-contributions] and [non-coding][non-coding-contributions] tasks that you can contribute to.
