**This folder contains the following notebooks:**

1.  *PAM-geting-started.ipynb:* quick spin through PAM. Intended to provide a technical overview and inspire future researc and development
2.  *Example-Create-Population-Londinium.ipynb:* This notebook demonstrates an example workflow for creating a sample population automatically for the west London area. It creates test agent plans of person and households.
3.  *PAM-Create-Population.ipynb:* This notebook demonstrates an example workflow for creating a sample population manually.
4.  *Example-Create-Population.ipynb:* This notebook demonstrates an example workflow for creating a sample population manually. It creates test agent plans of five person and households and exports plans and agent characteristics to xml format for MATSim.
5.  *NTS Population Synthesis Example.ipynb:* This notebook demonstrates an example workflow for converting tabular diary data (household attributes, person attributes and trip data) into MATSim formatted xml population data for London households.
6.  *PAM Policies walk-through.ipynb:* Examples of household, person and activity policies, joint distributions, modifiers amd attribute filters
7. *PAM_Simple_Policies.ipynb*: Based on [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FQMa7dLe2cv1NEZnbu5cZo3v07tKXINwvOaLQYoEp-M/edit#gid=0) e.g.<br/> Household Quarantine, Remove Higher Education, Remove Education, Remove Health Activities, Unemployment/Furlough, etc.
8. *PAM_Complex_Policies.ipynb*: Based on [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FQMa7dLe2cv1NEZnbu5cZo3v07tKXINwvOaLQYoEp-M/edit#gid=0) e.g. <br/> Sample critical worker, Sample critical household, Sample vulnerable person, Shorten shopping activities, etc.
7.  *pam-geo-sampling.ipynb:* This notebook shows how to sample geometrical locations from ozone/dzone regions.
9.  *PAM-stats.ipynb:* ths file contains a couple of plots to visualize activity times and durations
12. *PAM_stability.ipynb:* This notebook explores methods for improving stability of the PAM demand modelling outputs.
13. *Travel plots.ipynb:* This notebook allows the user to generate GeoDataFrames which let you generate geojsons simpl and quickly. These can then be loaded up in kepler.
14. *vulnerability_probabilities.ipynb:* The aim of this notebook is to estimate the probability of belonging in a vulnerable group, broken down by age and gender. <br/> Our exercise does not intend on having any meaningful medical interpretation, but rather serves the purpose of deriving potential mobility constrains based on the perception of vulnerability for different demographic groups.
15. *weighted-facility-sampling_demo.ipynb:* The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate weighted and rule-based facility sampling methods.
